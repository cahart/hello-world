TSplus is pleased to announce the general availability of its new freeware: RDP Defender. 
It is a "must have" security tool.
 
If your Windows server is publicly available on Internet, then you are an easy target for malicious 
people such as hackers, network scanners and brute force robots. 
Without the proper protection securing the access to your server's identification, there is a high probability 
to see your login and password stolen and your server exposed to a criminal use. 
 
As you read this mail, your server's connection is being automatically scanned, reached and tested 
even a thousand times using current logins and password dictionaries. 
This is both dangerous for your personal data and your resources, as this behavior will impact directly your 
CPU and Bandwidth consumption.
 
Our brand new product brings the best solution to prevent this risk : very quick and easy to install, 
RDP Defender will  protect your RDS server efficiently by monitoring Windows failed login attempts 
and after several failures automatically blacklist the offending IP addresses.
 
                                 
 
Why spending more to get less, use RDP Defender.
It is compatible with any Windows Server and can be immediately downloaded on our website:
